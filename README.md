## üõ°Ô∏è Bungie API Authentication

RaidAssist uses an official, app-owned Bungie API key to connect securely to Bungie.net‚Äîjust like DIM, Braytech, and other trusted Destiny 2 apps.  
**You never need to register your own API key or developer account.**

* On first run, RaidAssist will ask you to log in with your Bungie account via OAuth.
* Your credentials are never stored; only a temporary session token is saved (locally, never uploaded).
* All communication is handled via the app's API key, so setup is instant and hassle-free.

**FAQ:**  

* "Will this get me banned?" ‚Äî No. Using the official Bungie API and OAuth is fully supported, just like Destiny Item Manager and Braytech.
* "Is my data private?" ‚Äî Yes. Only your own OAuth token is stored locally, and never shared.
