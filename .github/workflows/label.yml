    steps:
      # Checks out the code â€“ technically optional for labeler, but enables future extensibility (lint, coverage, etc.)
      - name: Checkout code (optional)
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Apply labels as defined in .github/labeler.yml
      - name: Run Labeler
        uses: actions/labeler@v4
        with:
          repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"

      # Optionally, you could add a step to comment if no label was added or provide other guidance.
      # (Advanced usage: not required unless you want to notify users.)

# Notes:
# - Using `pull_request_target` allows labeler to work on PRs from forks (safer for public repos).
# - The explicit `types` ensure the action runs on every relevant PR event.
# - If you ever want to use labeler on issues as well, add `issues` to `on:` (but that's not typical).
