# Tips:
# - The `{% if ... %}` blocks use GitHub's built-in variable support, but **actions/first-interaction@v1** does not natively support this.
#   If you want truly conditional messages, you’d need a custom action or a bot (like [actions/label-commenter](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-label-commenter)).
# - The above gives a great template for future upgrade, or just use one detailed message for now.
# - Always keep Discord/community invites up-to-date!
