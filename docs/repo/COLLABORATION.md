## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Clone your fork locally and set the upstream remote.

2. **Create a Feature Branch**  
   Use descriptive names like `feature/overlay-toggle` or `bugfix/exotic-status-crash`.

3. **Write Clean, Modular Code**  
   Follow existing conventions, include docstrings, and comment where clarity helps.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   - Explain your changes clearly.
   - Reference any related issue numbers (e.g., `Fixes #42`).
   - Tag relevant maintainers for review.
